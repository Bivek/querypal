Querypal is a web-based, query execution tool which leverages Amazon Athena to make authoring queries and retrieving results simple for users. 
Querypal provides the ability to find tables, see metadata, browse sample rows, write and edit queries, then submit queries all in a web interface. 
Once queries are running, users can track query progress and when finished, get the results back through the browser as a table.
